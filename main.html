    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It helps in analyzing how efficient an algorithm is as the size of the input grows.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> represents the amount of memory required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is commonly denoted using big-O notation, for example, O(n).</p>
